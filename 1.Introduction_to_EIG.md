# Introduction to EIG

The Eigenstrat format is a text-based format used for storing genotype data in genetics. It consists of three files:

**1. .snp file**: containing the SNP positions. It consists of six columns: SNP-name, chromosome, genetic positions, physical position, reference allele, alternative allele.

**2. .ind file**: containing the names of the individuals. It consists of three columns: Individual Name, Sex (encoded as M(ale), F(emale), or U(nknown)), and population name.

**3. .geno file**: containing the genotype matrix, with individuals laid out from left to right, and SNP positions laid out from top to bottom.
-   0 means zero copies of reference allele.
-   1 means one copy of reference allele.
-   2 means two copies of reference allele.
-   9 means missing data.
